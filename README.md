# A Code Surfer slide deck about C++ lambdas

⚠️ **MEMETIC HAZARD** ⚠️

Below, you will find my notes of the cursed process for building a deck suitable
for deployment on GitHub Pages (with a path prefix). It is not something you
want to witness. It might induce nightmares. **You have been warned**.

1. If you have just cloned the repository, run `npm i` to download the dependencies.
2. `patch -p0 < node_modules.patch` (told you it was cursed)
3. `node run-script build`

If you know how to achieve this without modifying my dependencies' code, please contact me.
